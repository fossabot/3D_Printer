3D_Printer
==========

Underverk's 3D printer is a fork of a wooden Prusa i3 made by Arduino Verkstad for the 3D printing workshops to be held at FBRKN, STPLN, Malmo, Sweden. It's playfully called the "i3 AV Remix"

It's a mashup of parts from:  
*   [Modified Parts from the EiNSTeiN branch](https://github.com/EiNSTeiN-/Prusa3)  
*   [The Prusa vanilla repo](https://github.com/josefprusa/Prusa3-vanilla)  
*   [The extruder is based on Misans version of the compact extruder](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:100982)  
*   [The frame is based on Shane grabers Laser Cut 6mm Wood frame](https://github.com/sgraber/Prusa3_LC)  
*   [And x-carriage was inspired by Shane grabers Graber printer](https://github.com/sgraber/Graber)  
*   [A modified version of this y-motor-mount](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:85809)
